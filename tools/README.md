## Tools and handy tricks

LWTOOLS contains the required 6809 assembler and linker. NITROS9PROJECT contains the zip files contains disk images for the most common machines.

### lwtools

LWTOOLS is a set of cross-development tools for the Motorola 6809 and Hitachi 6309 microprocessors. It supports assembling to raw binaries, CoCo LOADM binaries, and a proprietary object file format for later linking. It also supports macros and file inclusion among other things.

LWTOOLS was born in 2006 when William Astle decided that none of the crossassemblers available at the time supported all the features he wanted to use. After over two years of intermittent development, and three separate releases of LWASM and one separate release of LWLINK, LWTOOLS had it's initial release on January 29, 2009.

The full set of disks (the result of running `make dskcopy` from the source) can be found in the "disks" folder. The index can be browsed at http://nitros9.sourceforge.net/v3.3.0/
